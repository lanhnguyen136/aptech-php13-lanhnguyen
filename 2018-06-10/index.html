                    <p><b> Ho Chi Minh</b> was born and given the name of <b>Nguyen Sinh Cung </b>in 1890 in the village of Hoang 
                        Tru, his mother's village. From 1895, he grew up in his father Nguyen Sinh Sac's village of Nghe 
                        An Province. He had three siblings: his sister Bach Lien (or Nguyen Thi Thanh), a clerk in the 
                        French Army; his brother Nguyen Sinh Khiem (or Nguyen Tat Đat), a geomancer and traditional 
                        herbalist; and another brother (Nguyen Sinh Nhuan) who died in his infancy. As a young child, 
                        Cung studied with his father before more formal classes with a scholar named Vuong Thuc Do. 
                        Cung quickly mastered Chinese writing, a prerequisite for any serious study of Confucianism, 
                        while honing his colloquial Vietnamese writing.In addition to his studious endeavors, 
                        he was fond of adventure, and loved to fly kites and go fishing. Following Confucian tradition, 
                        at the age of 10, his father gave him a new name: <b>Nguyen Tat Thanh</b>.</p>
                        <p>Previously, it was believed that Thanh was involved in an anti-slavery demonstration of poor 
                        peasants in Hue in May 1908, which endangered his student status at College Quoc hoc. However, 
                        a document from the Centre des archives d'Outre-mer in France shows that he was admitted to 
                        College Quoc hoc on 8 August 1908, which was several months after the anti-corvée demonstration
                        (9–13 April 1908). The exaggeration of revolutionary credentials was common among Vietnamese 
                        communist leaders, as shown in Ton Đuc Thang's falsified participation in the 1919 Black Sea 
                        revolt. Later in life, Ho would claim the 1908 revolt had been the moment when his revolutionary 
                        outlook emerged,[citation needed] but his application to the French Colonial Administrative School
                        in 1911 undermines this version of events. He chose to leave school in order to find a chance to 
                        go abroad.</p>

                    <ul>
                            <li>Nguyen took up the job of a kitchen helper on the French steamer, Amirale de Latouche-Treville. Upon reaching France in December 1911, he tried his luck to get admission at the French Colonial Administrative School but in vain. Disheartened, he decided to continue his travel and sustained his work in ships until 1917, visiting many countries during the period.</li>
                            <li>From 1912 to 1913, Nguyen put up in New York and Boston. Taking up odd jobs for a living, it was in the US that Nguyen first met with Korean nationalists who shaped much of his political outlook.</li>
                            <li>In between 1913 and 1919, Nyugen stayed in various cities across the United Kingdom, taking up menial jobs as a waiter, baker, pastry chef and so on.</li>
                            <li>It was during his stay in France from 1919 until 1923 that Nyugen took to politics seriously. His friend Marcel Cachin, comrade of the Socialist Party helped him in the process.</li>
                            <li>In 1925-26, Nyugen was deeply involved with organizing Youth Education Classes and lecturing young Vietnamese revolutionaries living in Canton at the Whampoa Military Academy.</li>
                            <li>In April 1927, Nyugen started his journey towards Southeast Asia, stopping over at various cities including Moscow, Paris, Brussels, Berlin, Switzerland, and Italy, finally arriving at Bangkok, Thailand in July 1928.</li>
                            <li>He also travelled to India and later Shanghai in 1929. In 1930, Nyugen organised a meeting of the representatives of the two Vietnamese communist parties in Hong Kong, in order to merge them into a unified organization, Communist Party of Vietnam.</li>
                            <li>For this, Nyugen was arrested in Hong Kong in 1931.The unrest caused from the action and French pressures forced the British to announce his false death in 1932. Following this, Nyugen was cautiously released in 1933.</li>
                            <li>Upon gaining entry in China, Nyugen began serving as an advisor with the Chinese Communist armed forces. It was in 1940 that Nyugen changed his name to Ho Chi Minh, meaning He Who Enlightens in Vietnamese.</li>
