        <p style="line-height: 25px; text-align: justify"><strong>Ho Chi Minh</strong> was born and given the name of <strong>Nguyen Sinh Cung </strong>in 1890 in the village of Hoang 
        Tru, his mother's village. From 1895, he grew up in his father Nguyen Sinh Sac's village of Nghe 
        An Province. He had three siblings: his sister Bach Lien (or Nguyen Thi Thanh), a clerk in the 
        French Army; his brother Nguyen Sinh Khiem (or Nguyen Tat Đat), a geomancer and traditional 
        herbalist; and another brother (Nguyen Sinh Nhuan) who died in his infancy. As a young child, 
        Cung studied with his father before more formal classes with a scholar named Vuong Thuc Do. 
        Cung quickly mastered Chinese writing, a prerequisite for any serious study of Confucianism, 
        while honing his colloquial Vietnamese writing.In addition to his studious endeavors, 
        he was fond of adventure, and loved to fly kites and go fishing. Following Confucian tradition, 
        at the age of 10, his father gave him a new name: <strong>Nguyen Tat Thanh</strong>.</p>
        <p style="line-height: 25px; text-align: justify">Previously, it was believed that Thanh was involved in an anti-slavery demonstration of poor 
        peasants in Hue in May 1908, which endangered his student status at College Quoc hoc. However, 
        a document from the Centre des archives d'Outre-mer in France shows that he was admitted to 
        College Quoc hoc on 8 August 1908, which was several months after the anti-corvée demonstration
        (9–13 April 1908). The exaggeration of revolutionary credentials was common among Vietnamese 
        communist leaders, as shown in Ton Đuc Thang's falsified participation in the 1919 Black Sea 
        revolt. Later in life, Ho would claim the 1908 revolt had been the moment when his revolutionary 
        outlook emerged,[citation needed] but his application to the French Colonial Administrative School
        in 1911 undermines this version of events. He chose to leave school in order to find a chance to 
        go abroad.</p>
        <p style="line-height: 25px; text-align: justify">Thanh worked as a kitchen helper on a French steamer, the Amirale de Latouche-Tréville while 
        using the alias <strong>"Van Ba"</strong>. The steamer departed on 5 June 1911 and arrived in Marseille, France on 
        5 July 1911. The ship then left for Le Havre and Dunkirk, returning to Marseille in mid-September. 
        There he applied for the French Colonial Administrative School but his application was rejected. 
        Instead, he decided to begin traveling the world by working on ships and visited many countries 
        from 1911 to 1917.</p>
        <p style="line-height: 25px; text-align: justify">In 1941, Ho Chi Minh returned to Vietnam to lead the Viet Minh independence movement. He was 
        a Vietnamese Communist revolutionary leader who was Chairman and First Secretary of the Workers' 
        Party of Vietnam. Ho Chi Minh was also Prime Minister (1945–55) and President (1945–69) of the 
        Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam). He was a key figure in the foundation of the 
        Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1945, as well as the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and the 
        Viet Cong (NLF or VC) during the Vietnam War.</p>
        <p style="line-height: 25px; text-align: justify"> Ho Chi Minh led the Viet Minh independence movement from 1941 onward, establishing the 
        Communist-ruled Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1945 and defeating the French Union in 1954 
        at the battle of Đien Bien Phu. He officially stepped down from power in 1965 due to health 
        problems. After the war, Saigon, the former capital of the Republic of Vietnam, was renamed 
        Ho Chi Minh City.</p>
        <p style="line-height: 25px; text-align: justify"> Any description of Ho Chi Minh's life before he came to power in Vietnam is necessarily 
        fraught with ambiguity. He is known to have used at least 50 and perhaps as many as 200
        pseudonyms. His place of birth and date of birth are products of academic consensus since 
        neither is known with certainty. At least four existing official biographies vary on names, 
        dates, places and other hard facts, while unofficial vary even more widely.
